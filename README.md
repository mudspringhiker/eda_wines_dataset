# eda_wines_dataset

This my project for the Udacity Nanodegree Program's Exploratory Data Analysis course.

Using the wine quality data set, which I obtained from Udacity's list of data: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qEcwltBMlRYZT-l699-71TzInWfk4W9q5rTCSvDVMpc/pub?embedded=true, 
I combined two csv files and modified the data frame slightly to remove the observation numbers and create a new column, "type", which tell whether the observation is red or white wine.

My primary goal is to determine which input variables mostly affect wine quality. I determined this by calculating the correlation coefficients of all input variables with quality.
